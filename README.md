# SOHO-Project
this is a project that i've worked on, called SOHO. this project is for connecting a small lan in a small office area. 

I’ve created a SOHO using the Application of CISCO-TRACER 

Using the cisco tracer i was able to make a small LAN for a small office area, making them connect with each other and become active. 

This Picture shows that all of the device that is connected from the switch is connected and working and hasn’t failed or had any error. 

Each of the devices section is labeled, showing the IP address, which vlan It’s on and each section is labeled with a different type of priorities.
